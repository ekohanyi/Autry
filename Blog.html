          <h3>Surprising Diversity in the Indian Boarding School Experience</h3>

            On the morning of October 25, 1918, a Southern Pacific train crept into the San Xavier American Indian Reservation station south of Tucson, Arizona. As the wheels screeched against the tracks, slowing the train’s momentum, reservation superintendent T. F. McCormick awaited its freight. Beside him, a woman later watched as men lowered a coffin carrying her son’s body to the platform.

            Just two decades later, Jill and Gilbert Mojado (Cupeño) from the Pala Band of Mission Indians Reservation in northern San Diego County, California, attended the Sherman Institute. There, many students learned English, an industrial trade, and left or graduated to lead productive, albeit Anglo-​Americanized lives. Others rebelled, deserted, and retained many of the Indigenous traditions. The Mojados took the former path. In fact, they both yearned to attend Sherman. Jill, speaking for them both, recalled, “We wanted to come anyhow because our brothers and sisters were here.” Of their experiences there, they remembered having “nice” teachers, playing sports, going into town to see movies, and working hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both looked positively on their experiences at Sherman. Gilbert took a break from his studies to serve in the Navy during World War II, but afterward returned to Sherman to complete his coursework. In the process he met his wife, who was the counselor for Jill’s dormitory. The Mojado siblings spent the better part of a decade at the school, and both enjoyed their time there. Jill appreciated the skills and hard work that helped her throughout her life. Gilbert recollected of Sherman: “I thought it was the best place in the world … I met so many people and other Indians.”

            As these aforementioned accounts illustrate, boarding school experiences vary greatly. The Cante Sica Boarding School Stories housed at the Libraries and Archives of the Autry exemplify this diversity of experiences and disrupt common narratives that align with the extremes, which range from fully embracing the boarding school experience to horrific ordeals and even death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key themes emerge from this archive. Former students recalled homesickness, the trauma of adjusting to boarding school expectations, harsh punishments for not following rules, the prevalence of running away, the role of religion in the schools, the loss of Indigenous languages, and the effect of boarding schools on their relationship with their own children and families. But they also recalled how the school could function as a refuge from their homes, the benefits of vocational education, and how the school positively contributed to their careers and lives. Consequently, boarding schools were not wholly “bad” or “good.” Indeed, that is much too simplistic a dichotomy. The Cante Sica Foundation materials demand a more nuanced interpretation, and these recurring themes may provide an avenue for understanding patterns of both resistance and assimilation. They also suggest that to more fully understand American Indian boarding schools, we must break from the paralyzing paradigm of homogenizing student experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toward that end, it might be helpful to begin with some preliminary observations to guide future scholarship and conversations. Boarding school experiences, while not universal, may correlate to several factors. These interviews point to the importance of geographic location. By this, I mean not necessarily the region in which the school was located, although this also may be a factor, but whether or not it was an on– or off-​reservation boarding school. Related to this are who or what institution was responsible for the school’s operation and the age of students. Off-​reservation boarding schools were almost exclusively run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), were vocational in nature, and typically catered to older students. Distance from home also played an important factor. On the other hand, BIA or religious institutions (and eventually tribal nations themselves) ran on-​reservation schools for the education of younger students. The age structure of off-​reservation schools may be analogous to contemporary high schools, whereas on-​reservations were similar to primary schools, albeit with curriculum variations. These factors likely contributed to the diversity of experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps equally important as the location and type of school, the era of attendance provides important contextualization for understanding student experiences. Students who enrolled at boarding schools before the 1930s generally had different experiences than those who attended later. Strict military regimentation and discipline, overcrowding, and fierce assimilationist policies were hallmarks of this era. Beginning in 1928 with the publishing of the Meriam Report, and the so-​called Indian New Deal a few years later, boarding school reforms fundamentally changed the schools and students’ experiences, although this is not to say the students found them any less traumatic. Then, in the latter half of the twentieth century, tribal governments began to assert their sovereign authority over American Indian education, again altering the composition of educational experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cante Sica Boarding School Stories archive is an immensely important source for scholars and Indian communities. The testimonies disrupt chronologies of boarding school histories and demonstrate the diversity of student experiences. More importantly, they highlight the continued struggle in understanding the impact of Indian boarding schools. The schools are not a thing of the past, but a continuing part of living Indian communities, despite the schools’ efforts to eradicate “Indianness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As of today, many schools have shut down, but others still function under BIA or tribal jurisdiction. The United States government continues to support its commitment to Indian education. Just recently, on October 23, the Department of the Interior announced $1.2 billion in funding to assist six tribes in taking more control over operating boarding schools on their lands. As part of the press release, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell stated, “Increasing tribal control over BIE [Bureau of Indian Education] –funded schools not only promotes tribal self-​determination, but also provides greater tribal discretion in determining what American Indian children should learn, increasing accountability throughout the school system.” These policies reinforce tribal sovereignty and place the well-​being of children under tribal jurisdiction rather than in the shadow of legacies of federal intervention.
