This is a static HTML approach to the website, and thus each page acts more as a template for further pages. For instance, the article pages are all a template of a basic article page with specific things to signify blog-like constantly updating content vs. longer more permanent content. <br>
<br>
All of the individual pages are housed in this repository so they can be transferred to a different server later on, and are currently hosted on a tumblr site found here: http://cs155test.tumblr.com/<br>
<br>
In order to edit this site you can create a tumblr account and we can add your name as a collaborator, or give it entirely to you and delete our names as admins. 
<br>When you are logged in to tumblr and are an admin of the page, you can travel to the above URL, and a semi-transparent button will appear in the top right that will have an eye icon and will say "edit theme". Click this to view the editing dashboard. <br>
<br>
Once you are in the dashboard, you can click "edit html" under the "Custom Theme" header on the left, and this will reveal the full html where you can edit all of the code. Tumblr requires in-sheet style tags in the header, so the CSS for every page is located in the head. You can "update preview" before you save code. The code does not automatically save before you travel back to the dashboard, so you have to click save before you leave. <br>
<br>
The pages we have included in the prototype are located further down in the dashboard as a list of pages titled "/article-short", "/blog-example", etc. You can edit these pages by clicking the page name (the x to the right of the page name will delete the page). <br>
<br>In order to add a new page, click the link that says "+ Add a page", click the top left where it says "Standard Layout" and choose "Custom Layout", enter the name of the url where it says "cs155test.tumblr.com/url" replacing "url". Enter your code for the new page where the cursor appears below the white box. Make sure the style is in the head in style tags. Click save. 
<br>
<br>
Finally, you can click save and exit and all the changes will be published onto tumblr. <br>
