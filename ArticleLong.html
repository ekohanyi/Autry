          <h3>Whatever Happened to Thelma and Louise? </h3>

            When Thelma and Louise roared across movie screens in 1991, millions of women (particularly women of a certain age) cheered outloud. The controversial film told the saga of two female outlaws—“regular gals”—driven to violence both by male assault (specifically, a graphically depicted, brutal attempted “date rape”) and day-to-day sexism. Self-consciously mimicking Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as well as road buddy movies in general, the film ended with the fleeing protagonists literally driving off a cliff and into cinema history.
          </p>
          <p>
            With their unexpected gun-toting bravado and a willingness to enact violent revenge—both murderous and witty—on their male oppressors, Thelma and Louise seemed to express a pent-up rage shared by many women. Director Ridley Scott’s expansive vision of the Western landscape offered women the opportunity to be included in its traditional mythic properties. Women too could now access the individuality, freedom, and resistance to repressive authority that the West so often symbolizes in Hollywood. Before the shouting died down, the film provoked a national debate on female violence, admiring women traced the outlaws’ cinematic flight through dramatic Western vistas in cars plastered with “Thelma and Louise Live” bumper stickers, and first-time screenwriter Callie Khouri took home an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2005, it’s hard to believe that Thelma and Louise opened the “go-go” ’90s. Can it really be only 14 years since these feminist icons first entered our consciousness? In many ways, the fuss Thelma and Louise kicked up seems quaint and dated. One can barely imagine this film getting made these days, let alone raising hackles. In an age when Oscar-winner Halle Berry receives a Razzie for worst performance of the year as “Catwoman” and Jennifer Garner kung fu’s her way to the cover of Entertainment Weekly, women showing off their fighting skills seem to elicit only bemused smiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what happened to Thelma and Louise? How could a film that so excited audiences and critics just a few years ago feel so far away from our world in 2005? Many look to the attacks on 9/11 to explain these kinds of shifts in the zeitgeist. There is some truth to that, but when it comes to the kind of gender politics present in the Thelma and Louise controversy, 9/11 is a convenient, albeit inadequate, answer.  9/11 plays a part, but perhaps not the one most immediately imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first puzzle to tease out is whether Thelma and Louise actually spoke to 1990s women. Was this really the film that understood American women in 1991? Perhaps not so much. In many ways, Thelma and Louise represented a 1970s sensibility that finally made it to the Hollywood screen in 1991. Like most mainstream movies with a “political” point, by the time Hollywood actually makes them, the message is pretty old hat. That doesn’t mean it’s irrelevant—or even no longer true—simply that by the time Hollywood gets around to putting it on film, everyone interested in the issue has long since heard the debate. Indeed, a whole new generation and a new set of political ideas will probably be in the public arena by the time Hollywood produces movies about previous political arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, Thelma and Louise spoke directly to women’s anger about male sexual violence. This was a profound (and pro-foundly important) issue for feminists working in the 1970s and 1980s. Susan Brownmiller’s classic book on rape, Against Our Will, came out in 1975 and provoked a national crusade. Feminists worked to change laws and prosecutorial culture so that women would report rape and law enforcement would go after rapists. As a result, rape law reform swept the country. People sympathized with Thelma and Louise because they were portrayed as victims of male aggression who fought back. The feminist movement had successfully altered the conversation on rape—and on women fighting back— during the previous generation of intense grassroots activism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the problems facing women who struggled against rape and sexual violence were hardly resolved by 1991 (or even today, for that matter). However, the sensibility governing rape had changed. Rape came to be recognized as a national concern, and sexual crimes against women were less and less the object of humor and tolerance. The images and emotions in the film came from the days before feminist activism intervened. Thelma  and Louise affirmed for women what many had been living with, working on, and angry about for years, but in fact, a new political discussion about rape began to emerge shortly after the film came out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Author Katie Roiphe described an emerging counter-consensus on rape in her 1993 book, The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism. And Roiphe, it turns out, spoke much more to the coming generation than did our cinema outlaws. It is in the contrast between these two cultural conversations on rape—only two years apart—that we see most clearly how dated Thelma and Louise truly was in 1991. Roiphe, a graduate student at Princeton University when she wroteher book, used the rape debate to posit a critique of feminism that she claimed celebrated women as victims. Particularly attacking the campaigns against date rape, Roiphe famously argued that, preoccupied with issues like date rape and sexual harassment, “campus feminists produce endless images of women as victims—women offended by a professor’s dirty joke, women pressured into sex by peers, women trying to say no but not managing to get it across. This portrait of the delicate female bears a striking resemblance to that ’50s ideal my mother and other women fought so hard to leave behind . . . But here she is again, with her pure intentions and her wide eyes. Only this time it is the feminists themselves who are breathing new life into her.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Morning After produced an explosion in feminist circles that continues to this day, but the conversation had permanently changed. Can anyone paying attention doubt that Roiphe correctly described the point of view that would come to dominate the political and cultural landscape? Even though Thelma and Louise were hardly passive wallflowers (after all, they fought back and killed the man who tried to rape Thelma), the movie’s emotional resonance was in its portrayal of the two women as victims. The heroic male police character played by Harvey Keitel refers to them often as “those poor girls,” and the film bathes them with pathos. Finally, of course, they kill themselves at the end of the film. Despite their supposed gun- slinger image, Thelma and Louise are, in many ways, poster girls for everything many women found troubling with the feminism of the 1970s. Like it or not, Katie Roiphe—not Thelma and Louise—snagged the hearts and minds of the next generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This attitudinal shift, however, is just one indicator that Thelma and Louise were old news before they even appeared. Although Thelma and Louise is often touted as the feminist film of the period, it was hardly the only media image with violent women at its center. And it is these other fictional women who provide us an even richer understanding of why Thelma  and Louise disappeared from the cultural radar so rapidly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thelma and Louise reached the multiplex in 1991, but Blue Steel hit screens in 1990. This intense police thriller starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a tough rookie cop being stalked by a psychopathic stockbroker. Written and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this taut thriller, more so than Thelma and Louise, proved to be a much better predictor of how women who fight back would soon appear on screen. Although no more violent than many Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood films that preceded it, the fact that the protagonist was a fierce female cop produced some yowls of protest. For example, critic Rita Kempley from the Washington Post practically frothed at the mouth in dismay, referring to the character played by Curtis as a “PMS Rambo . . . who is sod plain and up to her shoulder holster in penis envy.” (Kempley loved Thelma and Louise, by the way.) Conversely, Roger Ebert, who liked Blue Steel a lot more, commented that “the female ‘victim’ is never helpless here, although she is set up in all the usual ways ordained by male-oriented thrillers. She can fight back with her intelligence, her police training, and her physical strength.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It is this last description that speaks to the images arriving in the ’90s that ultimately buried Thelma  and Louise. TV and movie screens alike began to fill with female cops, female soldiers, female FBI and CIA agents, and female superheroes  (who saved the day when all those cops, soldiers, and FBI and CIA agents just weren’t up to the task of getting the bad guys). The characters represent the community, either officially or unofficially. They are not outlaws. They’re whip- smart, and although they outwit their opponents for much of the action, ultimately, they fall back on and rely on their capacity to physically overpower the villain. These women are tough as nails and, most importantly, they are the voices of public authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            These images competed directly with Thelma and Louise and have reappeared many times since. Remember, there was an even more celebrated feminist film in 1991—although we usually simply think of it as the movie that brought us supervillain Hannibal Lecter: Silence of the Lambs. Taking home every Oscar worth having, Silence of the Lambs introduced the young, tough, resourceful FBI trainee Clarice Starling, portrayed by Best Actress Oscar—winner Jodie Foster. Starling, the object of Lecter’s admiration and desire, cracks the case from only a few cryptic clues provided by Hannibal the Cannibal, and single-handedly takes out the film’s lesser psychopath in a terrifying, violent climax. That same year, Linda Hamilton bulked up and helped Arnold Schwarzenegger save the world in Terminator 2. Hamilton could be seen as a transition figure between the outlaw heroine and the official heroine. She is on the run—but from the evil machine state of the future. It hardly counts. In 1992, Demi Moore kicked off her cinematic military career as a Navy lawyer in A Few Good Men. This tepid foray into depicting military women was swiftly updated in 1997 when Moore teamed with Thelma and Louise director Ridley Scott in G.I. Jane. Scott began his move into films chronicling martial values (Gladiator [2000], Black Hawk Down [2001], Kingdom of Heaven [2005]) with G.I Jane, a controversial, violent fantasy of a woman training to be a Navy SEAL. Moore plays a noble female Navy officer (Lt. Jordan O’Neil) who opposes “women’s lib” and just wants to be treated like the male SEAL candidates. O’Neil’s biggest enemy is the corrupt feminist U.S. senator who is using her for political gain. Ultimately, O’Neil proves her mettle by surviving a vicious beating meted out by her training officer and, as one critic phrased it, “spewing from her bloody mouth a very male (physically impossible for her, in fact) vulgarity.” Although Meg Ryan actually got to war first with her turn as a Gulf War hero in 1996’s Courage Under Fire, G.I. Jane’s rowdiness more richly represents the genre. Although fighting women had sporadically  appeared on television in the past (most obviously, Emma Peel from the 1960s’ The Avengers), they were rare figures whose notoriety came precisely from their novelty. However, in the 1990s, a postfeminist television “tough girl” invasion began that continues unabated today. Initially, fantasy females paved the way for their more reality-based sisters. Xena: Warrior Princess (1995–2001) presented a superhuman outlaw warrior with a mish-mash of vague mythical pasts. Stronger than any- one from several imaginary universes, she turned away from her own brutal history and used her powers only for good. The TV version of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003; originally a “tough Valley girl” film from 1992) provided teenage girls (and fond adult academics) everywhere the ultimate fighting role model—an oversensitive 16-year- old assigned by destiny to save the world with her karate kicks, a pointed stick, and a handy quip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gradually, television got comfortable with such figures, and “real” women took over. Agent Scully on The X-Files  (1993–2002) rarely used her gun, but her place as an authority figure—representing rationality and science itself—was central to the series’ success. Although brains-over-brawn continues to characterize many of TV’s best female crime fighters, almost all project a genuine capacity for violence and intimidation. Jennifer Garner’s federal agent, Sidney, on Alias (2001–) manhandles all opponents. Mariska Hargitay’s detec- tive, Olivia, on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (1999–) matches acting partner Christopher Meloni’s menacing glares twitch-for- twitch. And no one would mess with Marg Helgenberger’s ex-stripper/ crime lab character, Katherine, on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000–). Helgenberger plays her with a steely, cold edge that the show intentionally frames as sexually enticing. Strong female authority figures with the power to subdue the villain—and the audience—are increasingly commonplace on TV. It is these figures who reveal most effectively what happened  to Thelma and Louise. In today’s popular culture, it is distinctly passé for outlaw women to turn violent because they have been victimized by a male-dominated society. Such characters have now become the very sources of authority that used to be depicted as their oppressors. Just like Thelma and Louise, these women carry the potential for violence and act to right injustice. However, they do so in the service of the state, which is now presented as the protector of the female victim. To some degree, this can be seen as an almost explicit main-stream media project of rehabilitating the state and the military after a generation of skeptical popular culture resistance. The military, the police, the FBI, and the CIA are the “good guys.” And oneway the audience knows they are the good guys is because tough women fight in their ranks as equals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, the attacks on 9/11/2001 accelerated this attitude shift as the country rallied in response. Some of these crime-fighting characters have made their appearance post–9/11. Yet the change in attitude—as the record above reveals—preceded this national tragedy by many years. The country itself entered a more openly patriotic era both during and after Ronald Reagan’s presidency. So too did media images become more supportive of the state and its representatives. The roots of this new role for female characters can be seen well ahead of 9/1 and even before Thelma and Louise made their screen appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you think this development is positive or negative depends entirely on your political stance. For many, it shows the true integration of women into (at least) media images of social authority. It can be seen  as both  a sign of feminism’s genuine cultural victory as well as a newly invigorated cultural respect for the police and federal agents. Conversely, those concerned with ongoing violence against women and continuing limitations on women’s status  in the “real world” might wonder if these images might not actually work to strip women of the kind of forceful fury against male violence seen in Thelma and Louise. If angry women support the state, then who will fight back when the state is the problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            So, whither Thelma and Louise? It’s not so much that 1991 was so long ago as that Thelma and Louise were not really representative of that moment in history. The national conversation had already begun to change by the time they appeared, and the excitement they provoked represented more of a last gasp than a new spark. In the end, one need look no further than the subsequent images from movies and television that incorporated female violence into a renewed patriotism, an expanded militarism, and a revitalized celebration of the state in order to see what truly happened to Thelma and Louise.
